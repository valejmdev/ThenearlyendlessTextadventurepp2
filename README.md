# The (nearly) endless Textadventure

Welcome to my Textadventure Website on which you will find a (nearly) never ending Story. It invites you to enter a username and choose one of three themes: Cyberpunk, Medieval Fantasy and Sci-Fi. But this is no ordinary Textadventure, as it uses an AI (Model - Llama 3 8b-8192) to give you an individual story as soon as you start the game. And as soon as you reach the end, you can easily restart the game with one click on a button.

This website has been created as the second Portfolio project for Code Institute's Full Stack Software Development Diploma. It was built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The Groq AI API is being used to narrate the story and give the user new options, aswell as a happy End. GitPod was used for writing the code for this website, as well as committing and pushing to GitHub. GitHub was then used to store the project after it had been pushed from GitPod. Once all the code had been written, GitPages was then used to deploy the website.
